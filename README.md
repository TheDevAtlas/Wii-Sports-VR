**'Continuation of my Wii U VR project with the Accelerometer, Gyroscope, and Magnetometer'**

---

Welcome to the Wii Sports VR project ‚Äî a continuation of my ongoing exploration into transforming the Wii U into a VR powerhouse using its built-in accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer.

This project builds on the foundation laid in my previous [Wii U VR Project](https://github.com/TheDevAtlas/Wii-U-VR), where I began pushing the boundaries of what's possible with the Wii U's hardware. This time, I'm focusing on recreating the iconic Wii Sports Bowling experience in VR, fully utilizing the Wii U's gamepad for an immersive and nostalgic experience.

# üõ†Ô∏è Project Goals
Better Gamepad Tracking: I‚Äôm using some cool techniques (Madgwick, Sensor Fusion, Ect) to make the gamepad tracking way more accurate, which should make the VR experience smoother and more immersive.
Reverse Engineering: I‚Äôm digging deeper into the Wii U‚Äôs system to figure out new ways to code for it and to access resources like Miis and other assets that Nintendo doesn‚Äôt distribute anymore.
Building in Parts: Wii Sports VR is coming together one piece at a time, starting with Bowling. If all goes well, I might add other classics like Boxing down the road.

# üöß Work in Progress
This project is a technical exploration and a learning journey, rather than a commercial product. It involves research and experimentation with the Wii U's unique hardware and software environment that is not supported officialy anymore. While the primary focus is on VR Bowling, the techniques and insights gained here could pave the way for further developments in Wii U homebrew.

# üß† Learning and Other Resources
Throughout this project, I'm utilizing and expanding my knowledge of the Wii U system. This includes accessing Miis and other assets that are no longer available through official channels, offering a unique blend of nostalgia and innovation. Here are some links to the research in both Sensor Fusion Filters and the Mii's that I have found.
